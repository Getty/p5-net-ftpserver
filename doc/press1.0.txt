ANNEXIA.ORG (London, UK) announces immediate availability of
Net::FTPServer version 1.0, a secure, extensible and featureful FTP
server with a unique fully virtualisable filesystem
architecture. Net::FTPServer is now in use by over 4m users worldwide.

Net::FTPServer represents a radical departure from traditional FTP
servers like wu-ftpd and ProFTPD. Being written in Perl, it is secure
against buffer overflow and tainted data attacks, and can be easily
extended by loading in simple scripts (written in Perl). The whole FTP
server can be completely changed by loading in back-end
"personalities" so that you can, for example, serve files directly out
of a relational database or even from memory. The architecture is
modelled after Apache modules.

The server has been adopted by schoolmaster.net, the world's leading
online education community, and by FreeServers.com, a free webspace
provider, giving it over 4 million users worldwide.

The Net::FTPServer code is a Bibliotech project.  This company has
kindly donated the code to the community and has provided web space
and resources to host the website.

Net::FTPServer is available from http://ftpserver.annexia.org/ and
from CPAN. It is distributed under the terms of the GNU General Public
License (GPL).
