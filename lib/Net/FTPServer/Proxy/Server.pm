=head1 NAME

Net::FTPServer::Proxy::Server - Proxy FTP server

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  proxy-ftpd [-d] [-v] [-p port] [-s] [-S] [-V] [-C conf_file]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

C<Net::FTPServer::Proxy::Server> is a "reverse proxy" FTP server which
just forwards requests through to another FTP server. You can use it
for firewalls, for example.

=head1 CONFIGURATION

C<Net::FTPServer::Proxy::Server> can only proxy to one FTP server for
each virtual host. In other words, it doesn't make remote servers
appear as subdirectories or anything like that, since the FTP
authentication protocol makes this very hard.

You will need to start the FTP server using the C<proxy-ftpd.pl>
script.

To proxy a single server, you need this global configuration file
entry:

 proxy to: hostname [port]

To proxy multiple servers using IP-based virtual hosts, use:

 enable virtual hosts: 1

 <Host proxy.bob.example.com>
   ip: 1.2.3.4
   proxy to: hostname1 [port]
 </Host>

 <Host proxy.bob.example.com>
   ip: 1.2.3.5
   proxy to: hostname2 [port]
 </Host>
